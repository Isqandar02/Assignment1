                    <p>Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham shared a graphic of the estimated R0 in the past two weeks on his Facebook page.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On Jan 28, the R0 was 1.05, going up to 1.16 on Jan 31 before reducing to 0.99 on Feb 5, and subsequently to 0.88 on Thursday (Feb 11).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The R0 in the states, however differs, with Selangor, Penang and Melaka having the highest rates at 1.04, 1.04, and 1.13, respectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The R0 of a virus is a measure of its transmission, or number of new infections generated by each case.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>An R0 rate of 1, for example, means that on average, each infected person will infect one other person they come in contact with.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>According to a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model on the forecasts of daily cases from September last year to May, the number of cases could reach 10,000 by mid-March with an R0 of 1.2.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the lower R0 rate of 1.1, Malaysia would reach the 9,000 daily cases mark in the fourth week of May.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Dr Noor Hisham has previously said that the R0 has to be reduced to 0.5 to break the chain of infection in the country.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>He has also said that the second movement control order that was placed on the country in January had resulted in a decline in the number of cases.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As of Thursday, the country recorded 254,988 Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic last year with the death toll at 936.</p>
