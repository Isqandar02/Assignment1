                    <p>Senior Minister for Security Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government will also allow dine-ins at restaurants, with two people seated at a table and physical distancing of at least 1m between each diner.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The moves followed a controversial decision last week when the government allowed night markets and hair salons along with barbers to reopen, although Covid-19 case numbers remain high.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mosques have also been allowed to reopen in most states at half or quarter capacity, while adhering to health protocols.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri said that the National Security Council's special committee has agreed to allow more businesses to reopen, including clothing stores, toy stores and sports equipment shops.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Outlets selling cosmetics, kitchen appliances, shoes, photography studios, nurseries and florists will also be allowed to open.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>He reminded them to continue adhering to strict health protocols called standard operating procedures (SOP) in Malaysia.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"The special committee has decided to allow these businesses to operate with strict SOP in place.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"They are allowed to open for business beginning Feb 10," he said at his daily news briefing on Covid-19.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These businesses must disinfect their premises three times a day, while clothes stores are to provide customers with disposable gloves to use, he said.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The use of face masks among staff and customers is a must and details such as the names and contact numbers of visitors as well as their temperatures must be recorded.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The use of product testers or samples are not allowed at cosmetics shops.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Malaysia on Tuesday logged 2,764 new coronavirus infections to bring the cumulative total to 248,316 cases.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was the lowest daily figure in about five weeks, with daily cases mostly staying above 3,000 since the middle of last month.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There were also 13 new deaths on Tuesday, raising total fatalities to 909.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Most of the country except for Sarawak state is in the fifth of a six-week Movement Control Order (MCO), with the government advising people to stay home and to work from home as far as possible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But government officials have also said that shutting most activities could cause deeper damage to the economy and more job losses.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The lockdown has cost the economy an estimated RM700 million (S$230 million) daily, Bloomberg reported.</p>
